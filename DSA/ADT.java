      // An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a data type defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of view of a user,
      // specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.
      // Examples of ADTs include List, Stack, Queue, Set, and Map.
